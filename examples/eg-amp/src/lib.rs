extern crate libc;

use std::ptr;

// This is a simple "amplifier" plugin. It holds references to input and output
// buffers, and a reference to a single number (gain) by which the input buffer
// is multiplied. Memory managemet of these resources is done by the host.

pub struct AmpNew<'a> {
    gain: &'a f32,
    input: &'a [f32],
    output: &'a mut [f32],

// The main question is: Should one use raw pointers instead of references in this
// struct?

// I'd say NO, because:

// I want to implement "lv2::LV2HandleNew"
// without having to use "unsafe", i.e. to "provide a safe interface" to the
// lv2 library. What is the correct (let's say idiomatic) way to "provide a safe
// interface"?

// I'd say YES, because:

// *) AFAIK it's impossible to implement a constructor "::new()" function for this
// struct, since the resources go out of scope when "new()" terminates. Instead, the
// plugin is instantiated by the lv2::instantiate::<>() function using
// libc::malloc(), similar to the code I commented at the bottom of this page.
// It seems weired to not being able to allocate the plugin from safe code.
// How would one design a plugin interface in pure Rust (i.e.
// with a host written in Rust)?

// *) There are potential problems arising with unkown buffer sizes. The function
// connect_port() below takes an "&'a mut [f32]", which is constructed in the
// calling function (containing unsafe code) by "slice::from_raw_parts_mut()",
// which needs a buffer size as argument. This size is not passed by host to
// the extern "C" connect_port(). Instead,
// the host passes the "n_samples" argument to the real-time "run()" function to
// indicate the length of the buffer.
// This may not be an issue, since one can pass a really high buffer size
// to "slice::from_raw_parts_mut()" without having to worry about perfomance/space,
// since no resources are actually allocated anyways, right?

// The reason why "lv2::instantiate::<>" etc. CAN be generic, is that those functions
// get passed to C via FUNCTION POINTERS contained in a #[repr(C)] struct.
// A secondary question is: Is this necessary? How to implement this more
// effectively?
